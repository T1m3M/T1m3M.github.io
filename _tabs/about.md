<span class="intro">A normal Computer science student by day and a malware analyst by night.</span>

In my free time I self-study malware analysis, also I'm in love with all the low-level stuff and always curious about how things really work under the hood.
<br>

Here you can find write-ups for Reverse Engineering (RE) challenges that i solve during CTFs, my Malware Analysis reports and the new things i learn related to Computer science or Cybersecurity in general
